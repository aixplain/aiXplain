Description:
    Mixins for common functionality across different asset types

### DeployableMixin Objects

```python
class DeployableMixin(ABC, Generic[T])
```

[[view_source]](https://github.com/aixplain/aiXplain/blob/main/aixplain/modules/mixins.py#L28)

A mixin that provides common deployment-related functionality for assets.

This mixin provides methods for:
1. Filtering items that are not onboarded
2. Validating if an asset is ready to be deployed
3. Deploying an asset

Classes that inherit from this mixin should:
1. Implement _validate_deployment_readiness to call the parent implementation with their specific asset type
2. Optionally override deploy() if they need special deployment handling

#### deploy

```python
def deploy() -> None
```

[[view_source]](https://github.com/aixplain/aiXplain/blob/main/aixplain/modules/mixins.py#L58)

Deploy the asset.

This method validates that the asset is ready to be deployed and updates its status to ONBOARDED.
Classes that need special deployment handling should override this method.

**Raises**:

- `ValueError` - If the asset is not ready to be deployed
