# User Documentation
aiXplain has a vast repository of multiple assets such as models, datasets, metrics, pipelines, and more. The factories in aixplain SDK provide a powerful set of tools for creating, searching, and managing these assets.

The asset types currently supported by the SDK are:
- [Model](#models)
- [Pipeline](#pipelines)
- [Dataset](#datasets)
- [Metric](#metrics)
- [Benchmark](#benchmarks)

## Models
aiXplain has an ever-expanding catalog of 35,000+ ready-to-use AI models to be used for various tasks like Translation, Speech Recognition, Diacritization, Sentiment Analysis, and much more.

### Explore
There are two ways to explore our model repository:

*1. Through the UI:*

The catalog of all available models on aiXplain can be accessed and browsed [here](https://platform.aixplain.com/discovery/models). Details of each model can be found by clicking on the model card. Model ID can be found on the URL or below the model name.

Please refer to the image below.

Once the Model ID of the desired model is available, it can be used to create a `Model` object from the `ModelFactory`.
```python
from aixplain.factories.model_factory  import ModelFactory
model = ModelFactory.create_asset_from_id(<MODEL_ID>) 
```

*2. Through the SDK:*

If you need, the aixplain SDK allows searching for existing models that match a specific criteria. `ModelFactory` can search for machine learning models that perform a particular task and optionally support a specific input/output language pair.

```python
from aixplain.factories.model_factory  import ModelFactory
model_list = ModelFactory.get_first_k_assets(k=5, task="translation", input_language="en", output_language="hi")
```

### Run
The aixplain SDK allows you to run machine learning models synchronously or asynchronously, depending on your use case. This flexibility allows you to choose the most appropriate mode of execution based on your application's requirements.

```python
# Run Synchronously
translation = model.run("This is a sample text")

# Run Asynchronously
## Start async job
start_response = model.run_async("This is a sample text")
poll_url = start_response["url"]
## Poll to see current job status
poll_response = model.poll(poll_url)
```

## Pipelines
[Design](https://aixplain.com/platform/studio/) is aiXplainâ€™s no-code AI pipeline builder tool that accelerates AI development by providing a seamless experience to build complex AI systems and deploy them within minutes. You can visit our platform and design your own custom pipeline [here](https://platform.aixplain.com/studio).

### Explore
There are two ways to find pipelines:

*1. Through the UI:*

The catalog of all your pipelines on aiXplain can be accessed and browsed [here](https://platform.aixplain.com/dashboard/pipelines). Details of the pipeline can be found by clicking on the pipeline card. Pipeline ID can be found from the URL or below the pipeline name (similar to models).

Once the Pipeline ID of the desired pipeline is available, it can be used to create a `Pipeline` object from the `PipelineFactory`. 
```python
from aixplain.factories.pipeline_factory  import PipelineFactory
pipeline = PipelineFactory.create_asset_from_id(<PIPELINE_ID>) 
```

*2. Through the SDK:*

If you need, the aixplain SDK allows searching for existing pipelines. 

```python
from aixplain.factories.pipeline_factory  import PipelineFactory
pipeline_list = PipelineFactory.get_first_k_assets(k=5)
```

### Run
The aixplain SDK allows you to run pipelines synchronously or asynchronously, depending on your use case. This flexibility allows you to choose the most appropriate mode of execution based on your application's requirements.

```python
# Run Synchronously
result = pipeline.run("This is a sample text")

# Run Asynchronously
## Start async job
start_response = pipeline.run_async("This is a sample text")
poll_url = start_response["url"]
## Poll to see current job status
poll_response = pipeline.poll(poll_url)
```

## Datasets
aiXplain has an extensive collection of datasets to be used for various tasks like Translation, Speech Recognition, Diacritization, Sentiment Analysis, and much more.
You can even upload your own dataset [here](https://platform.aixplain.com/dashboard/datasets/upload).

The catalog of all available datasets on aiXplain can be accessed and browsed [here](https://platform.aixplain.com/discovery/datasets).

The aixplain SDK allows searching for existing datasets that match a specific criteria. `DatasetFactory` can search for datasets that are linked to a particular machine learning task and optionally support a specific input/output language pair.

```python
from aixplain.factories.dataset_factory  import DatasetFactory
dataset_list = DatasetFactory.get_first_k_assets(k=5, task="translation", input_language="en", output_language="fr")
```
Note: This does not download datasets to your local machine.

## Metrics
aiXplain has an impressive library of metrics for various machine learning tasks like Translation, Speech Recognition, Diacritization, and Sentiment Analysis. There are reference similarity metrics, human evaluation estimation metrics, and referenceless metrics.

The catalog of all available metrics on aiXplain can be accessed and browsed [here](https://platform.aixplain.com/discovery/metrics).

The aixplain SDK allows searching for existing metrics. `MetricFactory` can search for metrics for a particular machine learning task.

```python
from aixplain.factories.metric_factory  import MetricFactory
metric_list = MetricFactory.list_assets(task="translation")
```

## Benchmarks

[Benchmark](https://aixplain.com/platform/benchmark) is a powerful tool for benchmarking machine learning models and evaluating their performance on specific tasks. You can obtain easy-to-interpret granular insights on the performance of models for quality, latency, footprint, cost, and bias with our interactive Benchmark reports.

The proposed benchmarking framework is designed for being modular and interoperable in its core across three main components (models, datasets, metrics) in its body to become a one-stop shop for all possible benchmarking activities across several domains and metrics. You need to choose these three components for the task of your choice.

*Currently supported tasks are Translation, Speech Recognition, Diacritization, and Sentiment Analysis with many more in the works.*

### Creating a Benchmark
You can create a benchmarking job on aiXplain [here](https://platform.aixplain.com/benchmark) or you can also use the SDK. Let's see how we can use the `BenchmarkFactory` in the aixplain SDK for the same purpose.

```python
from aixplain.factories.dataset_factory  import DatasetFactory
from aixplain.factories.metric_factory  import MetricFactory
from aixplain.factories.model_factory  import ModelFactory
from aixplain.factories.benchmark_factory  import BenchmarkFactory

# Choose 'one or more' models
model_list = ModelFactory.get_first_k_assets(k=5, task="translation", input_language="en", output_language="fr")
# Choose 'one or more' metrics
metric_list = MetricFactory.list_assets(task="translation")
# Choose 'exactly one' dataset
dataset_list = DatasetFactory.get_first_k_assets(k=1, task="translation", input_language="en", output_language="fr")

benchmark = BenchmarkFactory.create_benchmark(<UNIQUE_NAME_OF_BENCHMARK>, dataset_list, model_list, metric_list)
```

You can visit [model](#models), [dataset](#datasets), and [metric](#metrics) docs for more details.

### Running a Benchmark
Once a `Benchmark` is created (refer to the [section above](#creating-a-benchmark)), we need to start a new `BenchmarkJob` from it. It is really simple to run a benchmark:
```python
benchmark_job = BenchmarkFactory.start_benchmark_job(benchmark)
```
Note: You can start multiple jobs on a single `Benchmark`.

### Getting the Results 
Once a `BenchmarkJob` is up and running (refer to the [section above](#running-a-benchmark)), we can download the current results as a CSV (even for an in-progress benchmarking job).
```python
results_path = BenchmarkFactory.download_results_as_csv(benchmark_job)
```
