    Attributes:
        description (Text): A description of what the pipeline tool does.
        pipeline (Union[Text, Pipeline]): The pipeline to execute, either as a Pipeline instance
            or a pipeline ID string.

        name (Text): The name of the tool, defaults to pipeline name if not provided.
