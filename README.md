# aiXplain

aixplain is a software development kit (SDK) for the [aiXplain](https://aixplain.com/) platform. With aixplain, developers can quickly and easily:

- [Discover](https://aixplain.com/platform/discovery/) aiXplainâ€™s ever-expanding catalog of 35,000+ ready-to-use AI models and utilize them.
- [Benchmark](https://aixplain.com/platform/benchmark/) AI systems by choosing models, datasets and metrics.
- [Design](https://aixplain.com/platform/studio/) their own custom pipelines and run them.

[ðŸŽ“ **Documentation**](docs/user/user_doc.md)

ðŸ”Ž **Find [models](https://platform.aixplain.com/discovery/models), [datasets](https://platform.aixplain.com/discovery/datasets), [metrics](https://platform.aixplain.com/discovery/metrics) on the platform.**

:yellow_heart: Our repository is constantly evolving. With the help of the scientific community, we plan to add even more datasets, models, and metrics across domains and tasks.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To install simply,
```bash
pip install aixplain
```

###  API Key Setup
Before you can use the aixplain SDK, you'll need to obtain an API key from our platform. For details refer this [Team API Key Guide](docs/user/api_setup.md).

Once you get the API key, you'll  need to add this API key as an environment variable on your system.
#### Linux or macOS
```bash
export TEAM_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
#### Windows
```bash
set TEAM_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
#### Jupyter Notebook
```
%env TEAM_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Usage

Letâ€™s see how we can use aixplain to run a machine translation model.

```python
from aixplain.factories.model_factory  import ModelFactory
model = ModelFactory.get("61b27086c45ecd3c10d0608c") # Got the ID of an MT model from on our platform
translation = model.run("This is a sample text") # Alternatively, you can input a public URL or provide a file path on your local machine.
```
*Check out the [explore section](docs/user/user_doc.md#explore) of our guide on Models to get the ID of your desired model*
